# üìù FreeNotes: An Anonymous Confession Board

![Cover Image](/FreeNotes_Cover.png)

**FreeNotes** is an anonymous confession board where you can share your deepest thoughts without fear.

This project is inspired from UnsentProject, an anonymous confession board aimed at confessing unconveyed feelings for first loves and crushes. While FreeNotes is similar, it also provides user authentication to review or delete any specific notes published as well.
